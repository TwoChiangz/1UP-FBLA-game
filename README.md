Programs used:

Yoyo GameMaker

We learned how to make a new game using the free software Yoyo GameMaker. The process was split between back end, front end, and design. Esther spearheaded the design side, while Raymond worked with the front end. Lam and Edwin worked on back end coding used for moving the game forward. With this experience we learned about sprites, objects, and scripts. All parts of this was used to put the game together.
